            The clipPath is an element defined by the provided XML shape (in this case, the path element).
            The clipPath element defines the region in which elements that use the clipPath, are visisble in,
            otherwise, these elements are invisible

            Note: Here we created a path element which defines the region, and we create another element with the exact same XML shape, position, etc...
            and we animate them at the same time with the same stlye to give the effect that an object when over another reveals something underneath
            -->

            <!--For every object that uses the clipPath, I think another of these shapes is generated => if applied to many, either create multiple clipPaths or apply a clipPath to a group-->
